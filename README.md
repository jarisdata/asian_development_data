## (Asian) Development Dashboard

The dashboard visualizes a collection of key political and economic development indicators. 


The full dataset dataset covers 106 country over 3,000 consecutive country-years, which probably makes it the longest uninterrupted time-series of the conjunction of political and economic development. The data comes from various sources, including but not limited to the Political Settlements Dataset (PSD), Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Fraser Economic Freedom of the World, UN, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Economic Transformation Database (ETD), Atlas of Economic Complexity, Penn World Tables (PWT), Government Revenue Dataset (GRD), Statistics on Public Expenditures for Economic Development (SPEED), Centre for Business Research Labour Regulation Index (CBRâ€“LRI), and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) among many others.

The conceptualization of the dataset relies heavily on my PhD project, which is why at this stage only a snippet of the data is up for display at the moment. A major update with global coverage, a detailed codebook with descriptions of the indicators and the method of aggregation will be published in the future can be expected toward the end of 2024. 

The dashboard itself is still in its very early stages, but some of the core functionality is already there. When using the following link make sure to play around a bit with the different graphs to cache the data for smoother usability: [http://jarisdata.pythonanywhere.com/](http://jarisdata.pythonanywhere.com/)
