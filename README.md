## Asian Development Dashboard

The dashboard visualizes a collection of key political and economic development indicators. The data comes from various sources, including but not limited to the Political Settlements Dataset (PSD), Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Fraser Economic Freedom of the World, UN, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Economic Transformation Database (ETD), Atlas of Economic Complexity, Penn World Tables (PWT), Government Revenue Dataset (GRD), Statistics on Public Expenditures for Economic Development (SPEED), Centre for Business Research Labour Regulation Index (CBRâ€“LRI), and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

A conceptualization of the dataset heavily relies on my PhD project. A detailed codebook with descriptions of the indicators and the method of aggregation will be published in the future. Even though the data and the dashboard are freely accessible on this GitHub repo please contact me before using the data.

The dashboard will receive further updates in the future. Its current form can be seen here: [http://jarisdata.pythonanywhere.com/](http://jarisdata.pythonanywhere.com/)
